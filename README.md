This is a modified version of a group project. shuffleImage.m, createTiles.m, and main.m were not written by me. Other files are entirely my work, except of course for vista.jpg which is a test image found through google images.

Features:
- Read image
- Shuffle an image into N pieces
- Reconstruct the original image by comparing the edges of the pieces
